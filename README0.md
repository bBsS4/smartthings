This project is an attempt to improve performance of Smartthings motion sensors that control a hot water recirc pump.
The problem I need to solve is that a 2nd motion sensor can go on, sending a start command, but the 1st sensor times out
afterward and stops the pump, while the 2nd sensor still shows motion and the pump switch should remain on.
